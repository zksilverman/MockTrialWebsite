Website used for recruitment for the University of Vermont Mock Trial Team. 

This website was created using HTML, PHP, and some SQL. I used a mySQL database to store a variety of data including survey responses and information regarding team officers. 

This website includes a form, which when filled out will send both the website administratior an email with the details, as well as a cofnriamtion email to the person who filled out the form.

The goal of this final project was to create a website without the use of bootstrapping that utlizes a variety of techniques as were discussed in the course.
