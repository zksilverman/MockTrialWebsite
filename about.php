        <h2>What is Mock Trial?</h2>
        <section>
            <p>Mock Trial is basically a court room simulation. Every year we work on one case, rotating between civil and criminal cases each year. Our team prepares a plaintiff/prosecution side of the case, as well as a defense side. We prepare case theories, themes, and general ideas for a few weeks. We are given case materials to work with, as well as case law and rules of evidence. Each side of the case has three attorneys and three witnesses. We prepare direct examinations and cross examinations, as well as opening and closing statements.</p>
            <p>In competitions, we will present one side of a case, with the school we compete against presenting the other side. If this sounds confusing or if you have no previous mock trial experiences, do not worry! Most of our team is compromised of people who are brand new to Mock Trial and we go through all of this in greater detail. Overall team members can chose whether they want to be an attorney or witness or both, and we spend the year workshopping the case and going to various competitions and scrimmages with other colleges and universities.</p>

            <p>We do Mock Trial through AMTA, or the American Mock Trial Association (not to be confused with American Massage Therapy Association :D). AMTA is in charge of creating civil and criminal cases, and preparing all the case materials. Currently there are over 700 teams from colleges and universities around the country (and some in Canada!) who prepare and compete with the same case. Through AMTA we participate in Regional tournaments, opening round championship tournaments (known as ORCS), and a national championship. Through AMTA we get the experience of competing with other schools around the region and country, and make friendships and partnerships with other schools.</p>

            <p>While Mock Trial seems like a lot of work, and it is, we pride ourselves on having fun! We specifically have executive members leading the team who are the Directors of Snacks and Activities. We make sure each practice is fun and each competition is fun as well. We often participate in other activities such as UPB Pub Quiz Trivia Nights, or competing in Canoe Battleship at Campus Rec. We often love to play a game of mafia after practices or do jeopardy-like trivia games. If you are a member of the team, it is almost guaranteed that you will play a game of "MidBands" or our version of Headbands, but with characters from the case we are working on. Mock Trial is definitely not all work and no play! </p>
