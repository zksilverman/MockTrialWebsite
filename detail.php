                    <h3>What is overfishing?</h3>
                    <p>There is currently a huge demand for sharks and specifically shark meat across the globe right now. There are even many cultures in which shark is considered a delicacy. An example of this would be in some East Asian cuisines, shark fin soup is a prominent dish. Certain species are fished for their meat, such as the spiny dogfish. There are three current species that are the most threatened by overfishing. These are the porbeagle, the oceanic whitetip, and three separate types of hammerhead sharks. Additionally, many sharks are caught accidentally. Sharks frequently get caught in nets and traps in the ocean, many are designed from trapping tuna. This leads to sharks being trapped, killed, and then discarded. Source: <cite><a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/shark" target="_blank">The World Wildlife Federation</a></cite></p>

                    <h3>How many sharks are affected?</h3>
                    <p>In 2000, there were an estimated 100 million sharks caught. Today that number could be closer to 273 million sharks a year, according to the journal of Marine Policy. This totals to anywhere between 6.4% and 7.9% of all sharks are killed annually. Shark populations are unable to reproduce fast enough to keep up their population numbers to counteract this massive population decline due to overfishing every single year. Despite sharks still being viewed as a dangerous and terrible creature, it turns out that humans are in fact now the main predators for sharks, and if overfishing continues like it is now, certain species will be directly facing extinction.

                    <h3>What can be done to prevent overfishing?</h3>
                    <p>In terms of legislation being done, the European Union has taken the step to make finning sharks illegal in addition to banning commercial shark fishing; however, this industry is largely unregulated around the globe. For what still needs to be done, there needs to be global and national legislation passed. Legislation can and should include preventing the sale of shark products that have not been legally fished and creating maximum amounts of sharks that are able to be fished. Additionally, there needs to be increased awareness and education around the issues of shark population declines. If people were aware of some of the harms being enacted on sharks, it could help mobilize populations to push for legislation. This highlights the importance of ecological education. <br>Source: <cite><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/02/sharks-risk-extinction-overfishing-scientists" target="_blank">The Guardian</a></cite></p>
