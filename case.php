        <p>Currently in the 2020-2021 season, we are doing a civil case. This case is the Estate of Genesis Petrillo v. Harper Martini and Peony Estates. Our current case is regarding negligence and battery of a winery/bed and breakfast, which led to a wedding party guest being either intentionally or accidentally poisoned with pesticides in a wine bottle. And yes all of our cases are this bizarre, but fun!</p>
        <p>All of our case are provided through <cite><a href="https://www.collegemocktrial.org" target="_blank">AMTA's Website</a></cite>, and every college and university will competing with the same case. Our case materials include case law, witness affidavits and depositions, stipulations, rules, and pieces of evidence.</p> 
        <p>The cases are always really outlandish and fun to work on. To access the current years, or any past years case material this can be done through the AMTA website. To log in, please contact any of the executive members of the Mock Trial Team to obtain log in information.</p>
