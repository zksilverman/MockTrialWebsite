        <h2>University of Vermont Mock Trial!</h2>
        <section>
            <p>Welcome to the official page of the UVM Mock Trial Team. Our Mock Trial team has been at UVM for many years, and it is a fantastic club with amazing students. We have people interested in pre-law, people who like acting, people who want to improve public speaking skills, and people who just want to be apart of a fun club on our team! It is a great place with lots of amazing friends! Our team runs through the American Mock Trial Association, or AMTA, and we compete at events and competitions across the Northeast.</p>
            <p>This year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are operating virtually. But despite this, we are all still practicing, competing, and have fun in a safe and virtual manner.
